When you move to a new city, you want to prepare for what the weather is going to be like. More than that, you want to know how the weather in your new city compares to what you're used to in your current city. FeelsLike takes two cities and directly compares their historical weather data to give you a plain English answer. Select two cities, view D3 graphs for actual temperatures, perceived temperatures, and daylight hours. Click the arrows on each graph to directly compare the two cities on each value. Check out the 'Compare' tab to see how the cities relate on a month-to-month basis.
