      <h2>Edwin and Candice's Thoughts on Pair Programming</h2>

      <img src="website-img.png"/>


      <h3>So What is Pair Programming?</h3>
      <p>Pair programming is a useful method of co-learning that facilitates a more collaborative feeling when creating programs. This method is used by beginners and experts alike. It's considered to be not only a productive learning method, but also a productive way to build well-written, functional code.</p>

      <h3>Why is Pair Programming Important?</h3>
      <p>Pair programming is especially helpful and important to DBC, because when it comes to programming we are all beginners. When we feed off of each other, learn from each other, and teach each other, we are engaging in a more dynamic mode of instruction. Also, this method of learning instills the values of team-based and collaborative creation of software development. </p>

      <h3>The Driver and Navigator - "Negative, Ghostrider, The Pattern is Full."</h3>
      <p>The two roles of pair programming are driver and navigator. The driver role is the workhorse during paring programming. They are the one with their fingers at the keyboard typing code. They listen to and are guided by the navigator. The driver has their own level of autonomy, in that sense they are not merely being dictated to by the navigator, but are using the navigator's guidance to implement their collaborative ideas. The navigator is the guide to keep the driver and the pair programming session on track. They are the chief researcher and problem solver. Imperative to both roles is fluid communication, where each are talking through their ideas and their decision-making process.</p>
