excerpt: "I'm going to graduate DBC. I was pretty confident that I would, but after destroying today's Assessment, I can breathe a long sigh of relief. Not only did I get through all of the test's requirements, I had time to go back and add extra functionality to some of the sections, just for fun. I've still got a lot to learn before I'll feel like a confident web developer, but I've now learned everything that DBC has to teach me. All that's left is to complete a final project and then actually find a job. I am officially a junior developer."

I'm going to graduate DBC. I was pretty confident that I would, but after destroying today's Assessment, I can breathe a long sigh of relief. Not only did I get through all of the test's requirements, I had time to go back and add extra functionality to some of the sections, just for fun. I've still got a lot to learn before I'll feel like a confident web developer, but I've now learned everything that DBC has to teach me. All that's left is to complete a final project and then actually find a job. I am officially a junior developer.

After the assessment, a few of us went out to celebrate and relax a bit. The afternoon brought more Thunder Talks, but there were so many groups that waited until today to present that it took a couple hours to get through everything. I spent some time preparing my final project pitches, but I feel pretty good about what I want to create and how to go about doing it.

The pitch practice with the team was a little difficult, since we have to cut everything down to under a minute. I did okay, though. It was really nice to hear a lot of people offer support and suggestions for making the apps work.

Until tomorrow, I'm Edwin Unger and I'm now a junior developer.
