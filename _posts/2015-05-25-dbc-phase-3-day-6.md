excerpt: "I spent the weekend accomplishing almost all of what I set out to, though there wasn't enough time to study for the Assessment. Instead, I finished my portion of the Thunder Talk on Serve Initiated Communication and finished decoupling my Stack OverFlow clone in order to present it today. I'm planning to have a code review on Tuesday night with a few people, so that should be sufficient preparation for the Assessment."

I spent the weekend accomplishing almost all of what I set out to, though there wasn't enough time to study for the Assessment. Instead, I finished my portion of the Thunder Talk on Serve Initiated Communication and finished decoupling my Stack OverFlow clone in order to present it today. I'm planning to have a code review on Tuesday night with a few people, so that should be sufficient preparation for the Assessment.

Today started with presentations, and I wanted to be the first to go. I was really proud of the work I'd done to decouple the app, but I'd also styled the app a bit and put in a few funny animations for my team's entertainment. Here they are for you as well.
