<blockquote><p>'Twas the night before Boot Camp, and all through the house<br>
you could hear the continuous click click click of my mouse.<br>

My dev environment was set up on my MacBook with care<br>
in hopes that some learning would soon happen there.<br>

Here I sit, alone, nodding off at my screen<br>
while visions of the command line creep into my dreams.<br>

When on my cell phone there arose such a clatter<br>
I adjusted my eyes over to see what was the matter.<br>

Through my new email I read carefully<br>
about all the new challenges waiting for me.<br>

Away to my editor I shot like a gun,<br>
and didn't stop typing until my fingers were numb.<br>

More powerful than lightning was my thirst to learn,<br>
And I yelled out each language for which I did yearn.<br>

"Now, Ruby! now, Rails! now HTML!<br>
On, Javascript! on, jQuery! Let's give them all hell!<br>

Build until you bleed! Code until you fall!<br>
Don't be afraid! Just give it your all!"<br>

Tired, drained, but still satisfied,<br>
I closed my computer with a short sigh of pride.<br>

I had many more hours of coding to go<br>
but this was a good start, the perfect intro.<br>

And I smiled to myself as I turned out the light—<br>
“Happy coding to all, and to all a good night!”</p></blockquote>
