<blockquote><p>'Twas the night before Boot Camp, and all through the house</p>
<p>you could hear the continuous click click click of my mouse.</p>

<p>My dev environment was set up on my MacBook with care</p>
<p>in hopes that some learning would soon happen there.</p>

<p>Here I sit, alone, nodding off at my screen</p>
<p>while visions of the command line creep into my dreams.</p>

<p>When on my cell phone there arose such a clatter</p>
<p>I adjusted my eyes over to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>Through my new email I read carefully</p>
<p>about all the new challenges waiting for me.</p>

<p>Away to my editor I shot like a gun,</p>
<p>and didn't stop typing until my fingers were numb.</p>

<p>More powerful than lightning was my thirst to learn,</p>
<p>And I yelled out each language for which I did yearn.</p>

<p>"Now, Ruby! now, Rails! now HTML!</p>
<p>On, Javascript! on, jQuery! Let's give them all hell!</p>

<p>Build until you bleed! Code until you fall!</p>
<p>Don't be afraid! Just give it your all!"</p>

<p>Tired, drained, but still satisfied,</p>
<p>I closed my computer with a short sigh of pride.</p>

<p>I had many more hours of coding to go</p>
<p>but this was a good start, the perfect intro.</p>

<p>And I smiled to myself as I turned out the light—</p>
<p>“Happy coding to all, and to all a good night!”</p></blockquote>
