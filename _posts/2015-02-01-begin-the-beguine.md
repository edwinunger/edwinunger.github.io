<blockquote>'Twas the night before Boot Camp, and all through the house
you could hear the continuous click click click of my mouse.

My dev environment was set up on my MacBook with care
in hopes that some learning would soon happen there.

Here I sit, alone, nodding off at my screen
while visions of the command line creep into my dreams.

When on my cell phone there arose such a clatter
I adjusted my eyes over to see what was the matter.

Through my new email I read carefully
about all the new challenges waiting for me.

Away to my editor I shot like a gun,
and didn't stop typing until my fingers were numb.

More powerful than lightning was my thirst to learn,
And I yelled out each language for which I did yearn.

"Now, Ruby! now, Rails! now HTML!
On, Javascript! on, jQuery! Let's give them all hell!

Build until you bleed! Code until you fall!
Don't be afraid! Just give it your all!"

Tired, drained, but still satisfied,
I closed my computer with a short sigh of pride.

I had many more hours of coding to go
but this was a good start, the perfect intro.

And I smiled to myself as I turned out the light—
“Happy coding to all, and to all a good night!”</blockquote>
