excerpt: "I'm ready. Ready to be finished with DBC, ready to return to the real world, ready to graduate and start looking for a job, ready to be finished with this project and start working on another one. I've been feeling this way for the past few days now, but wasn't really sure how to put it into words. I don't think I'm getting burnt out, because the first thought I have when I imagine the day after DBC is getting started on another project. I also don't think it's just this final project, since there's a lot for me to be proud of, and my fingerprints are all over it. I really think it's just my brain telling me it's time to move on to something new."
