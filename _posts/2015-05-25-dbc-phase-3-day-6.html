excerpt: "I spent the weekend accomplishing almost all of what I set out to, though there wasn't enough time to study for the Assessment. Instead, I finished my portion of the Thunder Talk on Serve Initiated Communication and finished decoupling my Stack OverFlow clone in order to present it today. I'm planning to have a code review on Tuesday night with a few people, so that should be sufficient preparation for the Assessment."

I spent the weekend accomplishing almost all of what I set out to, though there wasn't enough time to study for the Assessment. Instead, I finished my portion of the Thunder Talk on Serve Initiated Communication and finished decoupling my Stack OverFlow clone in order to present it today. I'm planning to have a code review on Tuesday night with a few people, so that should be sufficient preparation for the Assessment.

Today started with presentations, and I wanted to be the first to go. I was really proud of the work I'd done to decouple the app, but I'd also styled the app a bit and put in a few funny animations for my team's entertainment. Here they are for you as well.

Did I mention that our Cohort team name is the Pocket Gophers? I'm sure I did at some point.

Our lecture this morning brought us into some advanced JavaScript, mainly IIFEs, Closures, and Modules. Here's a quick rundown of each:

Immediately Invoked Function Expressions, or IIFEs ("iffys"), look just like any other JavaScript function, except that they have a '()'' at the end so as to immediately call them as soon as they are defined, like so:
<br>
{% highlight javascript %}
function example() {
  console.log("I'm being called immediately!")
}();
{% endhighlight %}
<br>
This is different from the normal pattern, where you'd create the function and then call it at a later point:
<br>
{% highlight javascript %}
function example() {
  console.log("I'm only called by my function name!")
};

example();
{% endhighlight %}
