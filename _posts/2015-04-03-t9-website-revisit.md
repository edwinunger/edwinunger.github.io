excerpt: "This week at DBC, we're learning about conflict. Conflict comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes and colors and flavors, but its most common characteristics are anger and frustration. Whether it be a minor conflict like taking too long in the shower, or a major conflict like spending habits and budget, there are ways to mitigate the emotions that conflict brings about."
