I come from a theatre performance background, but have been going in a very different direction for the last few years. I've always had an interest in technology, but recently that interest has grown exponentially, to the point that I decided to pursue a career in web development. For the last 18 weeks, I have been learning to program through Dev BootCamp, a fully immersive training program that turns non-coders into competent creators. I have now graduated from DBC, and am currently seeking employment anywhere that will allow me to continue to learn and hone my skills. My current goals include learning to code by any means available and using that education to advance my career.
