I come from a theatre performance background, but have been going in a very different direction for the last few years. I've always had an interest in technology, but recently that interest has grown exponentially, to the point that I decided to pursue a career in web development.
<br>
For the last 18 weeks, I have been learning to program through Dev BootCamp, a fully immersive training program that turns non-coders into competent creators. I have now graduated from DBC, and am currently seeking employment anywhere that will allow me to continue to learn and hone my skills.
<br>
My current goals include learning to code by any means available and using that education to advance my career.
