I'm a husband and a father of two. I'm a lover of video games, classic novels, and fine arts. I come from a theatre performance background, but have been going in a very different direction for the last few years. I've always had an interest in technology, but recently that interest has grown exponentially, to the point that I decided to pursue a career in web development.
<br>
<br>
From February through June of 2015, I learned to program through Dev BootCamp, a fully immersive training program that turns non-coders into competent creators. Since graduating from DBC, I am seeking employment that will allow me to contribute to the team while continuing to learn and hone my skills. I am an individual who is tenacious in my pursuit of learning, understanding, and teaching out my knowledge.
<br>
<br>
My current goals include improving my programming skills by any means available and using that education to advance my career.
